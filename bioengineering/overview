PDF introducing the program
  It seems dated now, eg the courses they discuss don't match the courses offered
  http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/engineering/programs/bioengineering/undergraduateprogram/documents/bsbioengineeringcurriculumguide.pdf

Cost:     $84,910.0 (my estimate, see schedule_analysis.rb)
Duration: 3.5 years (my estimate)

Progression:
  Enroll as pre-engineering
  Physics 1
  Then apply for Engineering program (I can maybe apply before then)
  Take the pre-reqs (there are 4, but I should be able to get out of the 2 that deal with programming)
  Apply for the Bio Engineering program
  Take their courses
