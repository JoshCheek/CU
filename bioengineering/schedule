*sigh* my schedule is based on this: http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/engineering/programs/bioengineering/undergraduateprogram/documents/bsbioengineeringcurriculumguide.pdf
but it's not correct, courses have changed: http://catalog.ucdenver.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=21&poid=5949&returnto=5457
but that document doesn't contain the list of bioengineering electives,
and doesn't talk about the two tracks (have they been removed?)

See these files:
  courses_all      - I went through all the pages in their course catalog to get this list
  courses_selected - The ones that seemed most interesting

Dependencies
  General Physics 1 (To enter into Engineering)
  Biomedical Design and Prototyping 1 (prereq for 2)
