This course url doesn't have a dash, all the others do:
  Fix this one: http://www.inworks.org/iwks2100
  It shouldbe:  http://www.inworks.org/iwks-2100

"Get Involved" dropdown:
  Denver Biolabs path is "/denver-biolabs-2"
  There is a "/denver-biolabs"
  There is not a "/denver-biolabs-1"
  Probably the existing "/denver-biolabs" should be replaced by "/denver-biolabs-2"

"Programs"
  The paths and titles only match sporadically

"About Us" dropdown:
  Probably correct
    "Our Culture" has the path "/our-culture"
    "Our Work"    has the path "/our-work"
  "Our Team" has the path "/our-team-1"
    There is no "/our-team" or "/our-team-2"
  "Our Mission" has the path "/what-we-do"
    Should either update the dropdown or the url
    Note that the page has main header of "what we do"

Our Team
  http://www.inworks.org/our-team-1/
  Kelsie Faulds' path is "/kelsie-faulds-1", should probably be "/kelsie-faulds"
  Louis Henrique Fae Barboza
    On the team page, his name is spelled "Luis"
    In the path and on his page, it's spelled "Louis"
  Monika Wittig's path is "/wittig", should be "/monika-wittig"
  Lelei Finau-Starkey should maybe have a dash in her last name in the path

White paper is out of date
  On this page you can download the white paper http://www.inworks.org/what-we-do/
  But it's an old version
    A footnote on the first page says
    "A shorter and more accurate version is available from jkb@ucdenver.edu"
    I emailed him asking for it, but he didn't reply

Main page
  http://www.inworks.org
  "+   design thinking    +   computational thinking    +    disruptive innovation    +   radical interdisciplinarity  + "
  Are the plusses adding them together, or delimiters? Either way, it seems like they shouldn't bookend the list
