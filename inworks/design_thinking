This is one of the ideas they're really big on, so figured I should research it a bit.
This is mostly a summary of what I found on the Wikipedia page

Design thinking refers to design-specific cognitive activities that designers apply during the process of designing.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking

Analysis and synthesis
  Analysis is defined as
    the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole
    into parts or components
  Synthesis is defined as
    the opposite procedure: to combine separate elements or components
    in order to form a coherent whole
  Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis

Diverge and converge
  diverge to get as many possibilities as you can
  converge to reduce that set of possibilities to the ones you want to work with
  Design thinking encourages divergent thinking to ideate many solutions (possible or impossible)
    and then uses convergent thinking to prefer and realize the best resolution.

Problem solving process
  define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement, and learn

4 principles:
  The human rule       – all design activity is ultimately social in nature
  The ambiguity rule   – design thinkers must preserve ambiguity
  The re-design rule   – all design is re-design
  The tangibility rule – making ideas tangible always facilitates communication

Useful for "wicked problems"
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problems
  a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize
  With ill-defined problems, both the problem and the solution are unknown at the outset

"A-ha moment"
  Prior to this point, the process may seem nebulous, hazy and inexact.
  At this point, the path forward is so obvious that in retrospect it seems odd that it took so long to recognize it.

Design methods
  techniques, rules, or ways of doing things that someone uses within a design discipline
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_methods
  examples:
    interviewing, creating user profiles, looking at other existing solutions,
    creating prototypes, mind mapping, asking questions like the five whys,
    and situational analysis.
