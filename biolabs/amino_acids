Amino Acids are Like a Molecular Array
--------------------------------------

Amino acids are used for these things because of their molecular structure.
You can think of them as a left hand, right hand, and data (I made that up, no one else uses it, AFAIK).
These are joined together by a carbon atom, it looks something like this:

```
left-hand :: carbon-atom :: right-hand
                 ::
                data
```

Due to its chemical structure, each amino acid's left hand can hold another's right hand,
like a red-rover line. Since the amino acid kind of looks like the capital letter "T",
we could imagine a chain of them might look like "TTTTTTT". This would be our polypeptide strand,
the thing that folds up into proteins.

The hands of all amino acids are identical -- they're all the same chemical structure.
The data varies across amino acids, and the molecular structure of the data is what
defines which amino acid it is, and what its properties are.
You could also think of it like leaves on a vine,
or elements in an array (not like a linked list, though).
