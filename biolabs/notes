DNA structure matters in terms of its function, as well
  This is becasue it is more / less accessible to the proteins

  Gibson Assembly
    http://www.snapgene.com/resources/gibson_assembly/

Unified atomic mass unit
  used for indicating mass on an atomic or molecular scale (atomic mass)
  symbol: u or Da (dalton)
  definition: one twelfth of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12
  One unified atomic mass unit is approximately the mass of one nucleon (either a single proton or neutron)
  numerically equivalent to 1 g/mol
  1.660539040(20)×10−27 kg
  Colloquially, "amu" means this, even though it's precise definition doesn't

Detecting cancer with nanotechnology
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bphPa7Wp4c
  put particles into the bloodstream that go around and release a molecule if they detect cancer
  the molecule is filtered out to the urine by the kidney, b/c it's so small
  this can be detected via, eg, a paper sensor or a spectrometer

  iGEM

  Molecular biology
  Recombinant DNA
  Molecular cloning
    A set of experimental methods in molecular biology that are used to
    assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms.

  Gibson Assembly
    A molecular cloning method which allows for the joining of
    multiple DNA fragments in a single, isothermal reaction.

    We use "cloning" here is because it involves the replication of one molecule
    to produce a population of cells with identical DNA molecules.
  Gibson Cloning

  Cell Transformations
  DNA mini-preps
  Restriction Digests
  Gel Electrophoresis
  Isolate your own DNA
  PCR amplification
  DNA sequencing

  Plasmid
    a genetic structure in a cell that can replicate
    independently of the chromosomes (via a self-replicating
    unit called a "replicon") typically a small circular DNA
    strand in the cytoplasm of a bacterium or protozoan.
    Plasmids are much used in the laboratory manipulation of genes.
    (these are apparently very important and I should read more about them)
  PCR
    Polymerase Chain Reaction
    is a machine (physical machine, I can see it with my eyes)
  PCR amplify
    Creates more copies of a thing
    We'll use it to create copies of just the pieces we're interested in
    which we specify with our primer
  Neucleotide
    One of the ATGC chemicals in the DNA, and supporting structure
  SNP
    pronounced "snip"
    Single Neucleotide Polymorphism
    Metadata telling us a region of DNA that marks a mutation as a location of interest (ie an eye colour)
    They have names like i7600
  Primer
    An enzyme that locates the part of the DNA we're interested in
  Enzyme
    able to bond with a section of DNA or protein
  Sequencing
    Identifying the letters on some strand of DNA
  Sanger Sequencing
  Phenotype
  Gene
    Heritable unit for transmission of biological traits
    A locus (region) of DNA that encodes function
    made up of DNA
    act as instructions to make proteins
    In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million
  Chromosome
    long strand of DNA containing many genes
    human chromosomes can have up to
      500 million base pairs
      thousands of genes
  Protein
    molecule
  Restriction digest
    the process of cutting DNA molecules into smaller pieces with special enzymes called "Restriction Endonucleases" / "Restriction enzymes"

------------

  First, we will be picking a gene of interest.
    We will then be cloning our gene into a plasmid,
    using Gibson Assembly.

    We can then transform bacteria
    to express our plasmid-gene construct.

    The bacteria will propagate, making tons of our plasmid.
    We will then isolate the plasmid and confirm proper cloning via restriction digest.

  Second, we will be isolating our own genomic DNA.
    We then PCR amplify a region of interest (whatever gene we decide to amplify),
    using primers that we design.
    We will then send these samples to ETON Bioscience and they will perform Sanger Sequencing.
    We can then analyze our data to determine if we have a SNP!!
