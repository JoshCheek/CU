Physics Questions
=================

(obviously I should pull this stuff out of the Biolabs dir, it's more general than that)

* In The Elegant Universe part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNBppoqZW3s at 38:06,
  Sheldon Lee Glashow says:
  "There ain't no experiment that could be done, nor is there any observation that
  could be made that would say 'you guys are wrong', the theory is safe.
  Permanently safe. Is that a theory of physics, or of philosophy? I ask you."
  What characteristic makes it "permanently safe", does it have no predictive capacity?
  Earlier in the show (26:27) they said "it predicted a particle which we know
  was unphysical, it's called a tachyon particle, which travels faster than light"
  this was used as evidence against it. That sounds to me like it has predictive capability,
  so how is it "permanently safe"? I don't see why its smallness is a problem,
  if it's a theory of everything, shouldn't we be able to infer things from it?
  Eg I assume there are a finite number of ways that the strings can vibrate,
  So for every way it can vibrate, what are the implications at that level,
  aren't there a finite number of ways these could then be combined into a more abstract particle
  (elementary particles I'm guessing), and can't we just enumerate the possibility space,
  identifying everything that is possible, and then looking at the properties of
  these inferred particles, based on their string components, and then enumerate the
  set of ways these can combine? It seems like it should have more predictive capacity
  currently, we try to explain something we've observed, this would predict things
  we've not observed or not realized we've observed. Then go look for them, and if they
  exist, that would be strong evidence in its favour. Is it able to explain phenomena
  like dark energy and dark matter? If not, then it's not a "theory of everything",
  and if so, at the very least, more correct than anything else we have.
* I don't get photons. I used to think of them as simply a massless particle,
  which, whose detection is perceived as light (eg, by my eye) and which travel
  in a wave pattern (eg a sine wave), whose frequency dictates colour (in the traditional
  sense, not the Quark sense). But apparently they are the "electro-magnetic"
  force carrying particle, these shows tend to focus on that and ignore light.
  I previously thought electrons were the electro-magnetic particle, and that spin
  was their magnetism, but trying really hard to make it through the Wikipedia articles,
  it seems that only bosons carry forces, so maybe electrons just carry state
  which is acted on by photons? Anyway, photons seem to exist independent of electrons,
  they travel from the sun to my eye, whereas my attempt to make sense of things like gluons
  is that they just exist between protons/neutrons in an atom's nucleus,
  holding them together. So, I'm not sure what my question is, does anyone have a model
  (or maybe equation) that would make the photon make sense, such that I understand
  what light, magnetism, and electricity are, and how they relate to each other?
  Note that there is a wonderful explanation by Brian Greene of general relativity below,
  something like that would be wonderful.
* Uhm, what's spin? First, obviously thought it was angular momentum (which, to be fair,
  I don't really understand either, but at least it's a thing that I have concrete
  experience with). Second, thought it was magnetism, I think from watching my way through
  Looking Glass Universe's videos like
  ["What is Spin? | Quantum Mechanics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd2Ua9dKEl8),
  but now I really don't know.
* Is the Higgs Boson the Graviton?
* Is this an accurate way to think about dimensions?
  Informally:
    "An axis of change"

  Trying to be rigorous, I came up with this:
    "Let 1-dimensional mean a single value from a set of possible values.
    Let n+1-dimensions mean an ordered set of discrete states of the n-dimensions"
* Brian Greene says this at 7:12 in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjFjC30-4A) video:
  "Albert Einstein says that spacetime is a four-dimensional Hausdorff differential manifold,
  on which a metric tensor is imposed that solves the Einstein field equations, and that
  metric tensor gives rise to geodesics, and objects that are not experiencing any other force
  will move along the geodesics described by that metric".

  I guess I don't really know what a manifold is (numerous attempts to look it up were unhelpful),
  but I'm sort of thinking of it like a way of folding a 2-dimensional thing through a third
  dimension, such that the folded form maintains some set of properties that we identify as "manifold".
  Eg my description should apply to a "tube" and the surface of a "ring", as well
  (they just maintain different properties).

  When he says it's 4-dimensional, is he saying one of these things?:
  * That there are 4 dimensions (3 space, one time), "folded" through a fifth
    dimension as we'd fold a 2-dimensional paper through a third dimension to make a tube.
  * Or maybe he's saying that the set of values is 4 dimensional, but there are some
    locations in that 4-dimensional space that have no value, or maybe are void of matter?
    In this case, it'd be like calling the tube a 3-dimensional object since it folds
    through three dimensions, even though being on its surface, you would perceive it as
    2-dimensional.

  I feel like he's got to mean the top one, otherwise it implies gaps in the dimension,
  which is incongruent with my definition of dimension. Also, my definition of dimension
  implies that if spacetime were four dimensional, then time would pass at the same rate
  for all three-dimensional points within it. But relativity shows that it doesn't.
  For time (the 4th dimension) to pass at different rates, it would need to be folded
  through a fifth dimension. A, possibly more intuitive example might be to imagine that
  we are unable to perceive height, and we come to a field with a hill in the middle,
  we would discover that we had difficulty walking as we neared the middle of the field,
  because we are walking up the hill. So, even though we are unable to perceive it,
  we can infer altitude from the relative rate of our traversal through latitude and longitude.
* Einstein's equation `E=mc^2` relates mass and energy. But we know the mass of a photon is
  zero, so for a photon, `E=0c^2`, and zero times a constant will be zero, so `E=0`.
  Solving for `c`, `c=sqrt(E/m)`, and replacing the values with our known mass and energy,
  `c=sqrt(0/0)`, which I think is invalid math. So, this equation seems to not make sense
  to me for a photon. From vague memories of calculus a long time ago, I remember we could
  deal with equations like this by using the idea of the limit, so perhaps it's something
  like this? `c = lim(m->0) sqrt(E/m)`. I don't remember how we resolved these beyond the
  trivial ones, but I'm assuming there's some way to calculate E such that the limit
  has a finite value that matches the one we measure. If not, what am I missing here?
* What is mass? I've been assuming it's a property of matter whose value indicates
  its tendency to be acted on by gravity. But this must be wrong since photons have 0 mass,
  but are affected by gravity (eg starlight bending around the sun). It would seem that
  my definition implies having no mass would free matter from that "four-dimensional
  Hausdorff differential manifold", which is not true for light.
* At 0:13 in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNb3H9kICbA) video, they show
  the smallest things in the universe:
  * Calabi-Yau Manifold: "A Planck Scale Manifold"
  * String: "A one-dimensional object"
  * Quantum Foam: "The Fabric of the Universe"

  These are all "1.62 x 10^-35 meters", which doesn't specifically make sense to me
  since "meters" implies a single dimension, but they're presumably more than that,
  eg the manifold looks at least 3 dimensional, and seems to have weird nonsensical
  edges the way people draw hypercubes, so might be 4 dimensional. Wikipedia says
  it has 6 dimensions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi–Yau_manifold

  The String is described as "A one-dimensional object", which would imply that there
  are a finite set of string values, and this is one of them. But we can see that it's
  a ring in the image, a ring is at least 2-dimensional, and it also moves as the video
  plays, implying the values of its 2-dimensions change over time, so at least 3-dimensional.
  Further, I'm assuming this is a string from string theory, where the Elegant Universe
  (linked to above) showed equations about how they can vibrate in several dimensions.
  Wikipedia agrees that they are 1 dimensional objects https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(physics),

  Anyway, apart from the confusing use of the word "dimension", both of these are
  the size of the Planck length. My understanding of the Planck Length is that it's
  the smallest size that anything can be, ie the unit of length. To be fair, Wikipedia
  says it's "the shortest measurable length" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length),
  so maybe things can be smaller than that, but they become unmeasurable. Anyway,
  if it is the unit for length, then there can't be any smaller resolution in terms of distance.
  But we see with both the String and the Calabi-Yau Manifold, that their values change
  across distance (eg you can traverse the ring of the string), which contradicts that
  their total distance is the unit value.
* Wikipedia's article for strings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(physics)) says:
  * "In string theory, the strings may be open (forming a segment with two endpoints)
    or closed (forming a loop like a circle) and may have other special properties"
    This implies to me that a string is an element of the set `{open, closed}`
    Thus, we could represent open strings with the number 0, closed strings with the number 1,
    and that's all we need. This makes sense to me, it's congruent with declaring
    them to be 1-dimensional. However, it seems false as:
    * later the entry says that they can have an orientation
    * why bother calling them "strings", wouldn't it make more sense to call them "bits"?
  * "Strings can be either open or closed. A closed string is a string that has no end-points,
    and therefore is topologically equivalent to a circle. An open string, on the other hand,
    has two end-points and is topologically equivalent to a line interval."
    * A circle has 2 dimensions, eg `1=x^2+y^2`, but they said a string has 1 dimension,
      it might be that they said "topologically equivalent", which looks like it means
      you can define a function to transform the point into the circle and back.
      (I suspect The Elegant Universe Part 3, at 8:06 describes this)
    * If the open string has 2 endpoints, then how can it be a 1-dimensional point?
      Maybe both endpoints at the same location? If not, representing the string would
      require you to also track information about the location of its endpoints,
      thus the string is more than the element of the set `{open, closed}`.
* Do the 11 dimensions have meaning? Like do they purely emerge from the math, or can
  we relate them to something we understand, like "in addition to the three dimensions of length,
  and the 1 dimension of time, there is a 5th dimension for every alternate possibility
  when a quantum superposition collapses,
  and there is a 6th dimension for every possible initial configuration of the universe,
  and there is a 7th dimension for every possible initial configuration of the universe, ..."
  Somewhere along the line I saw a description like that, and it made a lot of sense to me
  as a determinist since it simplified all of existence down to a data structure. Essentially
  "all of reality is represented in here, you just have to go to the correct 11-dimensional offset",
  or that this current moment in time for me can be located by fixing 8 of the dimensions,
  such that the remaining three dimensions are what I perceive as the structure of the universe's matter.
* Can anyone describe the Standard Model in terms that I could implement a simulation?
  Ie what are the characteristics of the particles and how do they relate to each other?
* This site (https://erc.europa.eu/succes-stories/how-entangle-two-electrons-–-and-do-it-again-and-again)
  says you can create a "Cooper pair" of entangled particles with a superfluid, and the
  Wikipedia article that describes it is far better than the majority of physics articles I try to read:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair
  I think I see (slash can understand with more thought) why this environment allows them to become
  entangled, but I think the thing I'm missing is why their states become entangled at all.
  Which is to say "given a pair of electrons set",
  or that this current moment in time for me can be locome entangled?" I've watched enough videos now that the pattern matching
  portion of my brain is expecting the answer will be something like "conservation of spin"
  ie maintaining some balance. If that's the answer, an additional sentence or two about
eristics of the particles and how do they relate to each othet across the universe,
  or just within those two because of how their probability waves interfered with each other,
