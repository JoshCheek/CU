Isohelix DNA Isolation Kit

Preparation
-----------

- [x] Preheat the EB (Elution Buffer) buffer at 700C (100μl per sample)
- [x] Set centrifuge to 13.4K rpm (12,000g), it is the only speed we will use


Collect DNA sample
------------------

- [x] Swab inside of cheek for thirty seconds
- [ ] Place the swab head into a tube


Remove DNA from cells
---------------------

- [ ] Add 500μl LYS lysis buffer, which breaks down the cells containing the DNA
- [ ] Vortex to cover the swab head
- [ ] Add 20μl Proteinase K solution, which digests (eats) contaminating proteins
- [ ] Mix immediately by vortexing
- [ ] Incubate at 600°C for 10 to 60 minutes


Unknown things for unknown reasons
----------------------------------

- [ ] Add 750μl CB (Column Binding) buffer, which maybe helps the DNA stick to the filter or something.
- [ ] Vortex thoroughly (at least 30 seconds)
- [ ] Add 1.25ml ethanol to the sample, maybe this kills anything the lysis and Proteinase K missed?
- [ ] Vortex to mix


Remove DNA from solution
------------------------

The solution is full of dead cells and proteins, it's basically cell and protein graveyard, kinda spooky, lets get our DNA out! We'll run it through a filter called a "column".

Anatomy of a column:

* A tube that is the postfilter basin
* A tube that is the prefilter basin, which fits inside the postfilter basin
* At the bottom of the prefilter basin, a faucet to drain it
* Within the faucet, a membrane that acts as the filter

We'll run our sample through it, 700μl at a time, catching the DNA on the membrane and let the ghostwater flow through.

- [ ] Repeat until the entire sample is processed:
  - [ ] Add 700μl of the sample to the prefilter basin, be careful not to touch the rim of the faucet.
  - [ ] Centrifuge for 1 minute
  - [ ] Discard the flow-through


Rinse the DNA twice and dry it off
----------------------------------

- [ ] First rinse
  - [ ] Add 750μl solution WB
  - [ ] Centrifuge for 1 minute, so WB flows through
  - [ ] Discard the flow through
- [ ] Second rinse
  - [ ] Add 750μl solution WB
  - [ ] Centrifuge for 1 minute, so WB flows through
  - [ ] Discard the flow through
- [ ] Dry
  - [ ] Place the column in a clean collection tube (postfilter basin) since the current one is all wet
  - [ ] Centrifuge 3 minutes, to remove all traces of ethanol (presumably that's the WB?)


Elution: Remove the DNA from the membrane
-----------------------------------------

In the next step, we "incubate", which is defined as "(especially in a laboratory) keep (eggs, cells, bacteria, embryos, etc.) at a suitable temperature so that they develop", but we only have DNA and EB, so are we incubating the EB? Is it al

- [ ] Place the column in a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube
- [ ] Add 100μl of preheated EB (Elution Buffer) buffer to the center of the membrane
- [ ] Incubate the column for 3 minutes (are they using "incubate" to mean "heat", or is my DNA at risk of hatching, or is EB a bacteria or something?)
- [ ] Centrifuge for 1 minute to elute the DNA


Store the DNA
-------------

- [ ] Store the eluted DNA at –200C to preserve it
