How Do We Know Any Of This Shit?
================================

I try to be epistemologically rigorous. In addition to knowing a thing, I try to know why
the thing is that way, as well as how we know this. Ideally, I'd like to perform all the
experiments at some point, that led us to the conclusions we have arrived at. This would
allow me to be much more aware of the set of dependencies in our knowledge, and would
help me improve my classification of the things I think I know. I also generally think
that if I could do this, then I would gain a large amount of the knowledge of the people
who initially discovered these things. How insightful it must have been, to discover
Calculus, atoms, DNA, etc. If I can walk through the set of experiments to build up
present-day knowledge, then I expect I'll have acquired some large amount of that insight.

So, how do we know any of the shit we think we know?  My intent (and I'll probably not
get very far) is to try to answer that question and document the answers here. With any
luck I'll get to perform these experiments myself at some point.

Things I'd like to be able to answer
------------------------------------

### Math

* Why it's a system we made up
* Are there other such systems?
* Infer: whole numbers, 0, negative numbers, Real numbers, irrational numbers (pythagorean's theorem & sqrt 2)
* Math tactics: equality, functions, substitution
* Infer addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, logs, matrices, imaginary numbers, quaternions
* Various mechanical properties of each of these
* Prove binomial theorem
* Trigonometry: pythagorean theorem, unit circle, sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, arc versions of each, various trig relationships, esp ones that relate angles and values
* Calculus: what is slope, creating calc via slope of a point, inferring integrals, relationship between integrals and derivatives
* Discrete math: combinations, permutations, set theory, factorials, binomial coefficients, properties of primes, totient
* Pi
  * Inferring its existence
  * Calculating it
  * Its qualities (maybe radians?)
* e
  * Inferring its existence
  * Calculating it
  * Its qualities
  * Generalize exponentiation and natural logarithm
* Infinite series
* Forier series
  * Inferring their existence / why they are useful / where to use them
  * How to find them
* e^(iÏ€)+1=0


### Physics

* Relationship between acceleration / velocity / position
* Age of the universe
* Relativity, specific and general, its implications: speed of light, relativity of time
* Why we think there are 11 dimensions, and what are they, and what are the implications?
* Quantum tunneling
* Superposition
* Uncertainty principle
* EPR paradox
* What is spin (magnetism?) / how do we measure it
* Where quantum mechanics disagrees with relativity, why we know quantum mechanics is true (lookingglass universe has a lot of good vids)
* What is an observer
* How we know dark matter exists / what is it
* How we know black holes exist / what are they
* How stars form
* Lifecycle of a star
* How planets form
* Lifecycle of a galaxy
* How some particles can have no mass
* What is gravity?
* What are quarks / what do they do / why do we care
* Is there a finite set of potential particles? (eg by our definition, we can conceive of all the elements, can we look at all combinations of quarks to infer protons/neutrons/etc?)
* Can we infer all cosmic phenomena by considering all combinations of elementary particles?
* Wtf are strings in string theory, and why do they matter?
* Pilot wave theory
* What is time?
* Why determinism makes the most sense (to me)

### Chemistry

* The existence of atoms
* Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom, and electrons orbiting the nucleus
  * I think this is the one where we shot electrons through a sheet of gold, and sometimes they would hit the nucleus and bounce off at an angle
* Atoms combine to make molecules
* Neutrons have no charge
* Protons have a positive charge
* Electrons have a negative charge
* What is charge?
* Why do charges attract?
* Are charges discrete?
  we frequently talk about them like they are, but this might disprove it: say an electron is -1 charge, then as it is orbiting close to a sensor,
  we are at -1, as it orbits away, +1, and as it transitions between the two, it is a gradient between them like a sine wave.
  Or, hold the electron in place, and back away from it. Initially it's -1, at some point the distance is sufficient to be 0, is the transition instant, or does it drop off?
  At the very least, it could simulate a gradient if taken as an average over time.
* Chemical bonding
  * Covalent - Sharing an electron in the valence shell
  * Ionic - lending/borrowing an electron in the valence shell, which leaves the atom charged, and then being held together by the resulting charge
  * Hydrogen - ??
  * Van der Waal - uneven distribution of electron orbit leaves a side of the atom more negative and another side more positive, these slightly negative and positive sides, then attract
* The number of electrons in the valence shell (2, 8, 8, ...) I think this is determined by 3-dimensional harmony, which I don't fully get, but I do understand harmony of a string,
  and can conceptually extrapolate that, even though I can't do the math to arrive at the answers.
* Nuclear fission / fusion


### Biology

* DNA is comprised of GATC
* DNA is transcribed into RNA by RNA Polymerase
* RNA Polymerase transcribes at a rate modulated by the protein named "transcription factor"
* RNA is comprised of GAUC
* Exportins take the RNA out of the nucleus
* Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus
* The nucleus is comprised of ??
* Ribosome
  * Walks along the RNA, 3 nucleotides (a codon) at a time
  * Performs an action for each codon
  * The implication of each codon
  * Where Ribosome gets the molecules it needs to make the amino acids
  * How Ribosome is programmed to do the given task specified by the codon
  * How Ribosome chains the amino acids together
* How the amino acids (polypeptide strand) fold
* That proteins are the folded polypeptide strand
* How the shape of the folded polypeptide strand causes the protein's traits
* Why DNA, RNA, amino acids, etc can form polymers (what are the qualities of polymers?)
* Why Carbon is so important
* Why humans only have 20 amino acids?
* Why we can only synthesize 10 of the 20 human amino acids, and where do we get the others from?
* Life
  * Speculation on abiogenesis
  * Why the common elements are common
  * Could we create it from other molecules (eg what is it about amino acids that are so important, do other molecules have that quality? could we create a similar system using the other set of molecules?)
  * How DNA encodes so much information
  * How we can get so much diversity from the system we have


### Neuroscience

* How neural networks work
* How our brains implement this
* The breakdown of the brain (names / locations / functions)
* How the brain develops
* Short-circuts in the brain (eg reactions that occur without conscious intervention)
* How are complex stuctures, like abstract thought, held in the brain?
* How do human brains improve? (ie in AI we would use something like backtracking)
* Where do we get: consciousness, curiousity, novelty, pleasure
* What an AI that could improve itself might look like
* What a generally intelligent AI might look like
