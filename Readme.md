My Experience
-------------

I watched some TED talks on youtube, so basically a pro.

Skills we'll learn
------------------

* Gibson Cloning
* Cell Transformations
* DNA mini-preps
* Restriction Digests
* Gel Electrophoresis
* Isolate your own DNA
* PCR amplification
* DNA sequencing

Course Agenda
-------------

1. * We will be picking a gene of interest.
   * We will then be cloning our gene into a plasmid, using Gibson Assembly.
   * We can then transform bacteria to express our plasmid-gene construct.
   * The bacteria will propagate, making tons of our plasmid.
   * We will then isolate the plasmid and confirm proper cloning via restriction digest.
2. * We will be isolating our own genomic DNA.
   * We then PCR amplify a region of interest (whatever gene we decide to amplify), using primers that we design.
   * We will then send these samples to ETON Bioscience and they will perform Sanger Sequencing.
   * We can then analyze our data to determine if we have a SNP!!

My interpretation
-----------------

I think a reasonable noun for the whole thing might be "Genetic Cloning".
We're going to pick a gene that we know corresponds to something interesting,
not sure if it's a human gene. We'll ultimately make a lot of copies of the gene,
presumably this is interesting b/c you could then do some sort of studying on it?
Or maybe you could then insert it into some host?

I can't tell if 1 and 2 are related, I'm going to operate as if they are not,
but it might be that we first do 1, and then we do 2 (ie two steps to a single proces).

1. Find some interesting gene lets say its the gene that causes glowing.
   We want a lot of it for unknown reasons. Bacteria grow exponentially,
   which is a good way to get a lot of bacteria. If we insert the genetic bit
   into the bacteria, then as they grow exponentially, so will the amount of our gene.
   So we need to get the gene into the bacteria, and the way to do that is through
   something called a plasmid, which is like a circular strand of DNA... maybe within the bacteria,
   or maybe you can like feed it the DNA or something?
   Somehow a "Gibson Assembly" will help us get the plasmid into the bacteria.
   So now, as the bacteria grows, so does our gene.
   Now, that we have a bunch of them, we need to get the gene back out.
   Maybe this is what the restriction digest does, or maybe this isn't specified,
   and the restriction digest is for confirming that we did it successfully.
   At the very least, the confirmation is performed by checking that the length
   of the plasmid afterwards is equal to the length of the plasmid before hand
   plus the length of the gene we inserted into it.
   Measuring length is accomplished by cutting the plasmid into pieces (pieces of DNA),
   putting them into Gel Electrophoresis, and running electricity through it.
   This causes the DNA to slide down the gel some distance that corresponds to their
   charge, which corresponds to their length.
   So, now we have a lot of genes that would make something glow?
2. Same goal as above (get a lot of copies of interesting genes),
   but via a different process. Here, we identify the interesting lets say "can turn invisible".
   But we don't bother with the bacteria thing,
   instead we have a PCR machine that can make a lot of copies of it.
   We put DNA with the gene directly into a PCR machine, and we give it
   something called a "primer", which is able to direct the machine to the
   region of DNA (locus) we want it to make copies of.
   So now we have a lot of copies, we ship em to a lab for "sequencing",
   which is probably just "here is the structure of the gene: AGGATACAGACCAGG..."
   This is probably interesting because, we can then check it to see if we can turn invisible.

iGEM

Molecular biology
Recombinant DNA
Molecular cloning
  A set of experimental methods in molecular biology that are used to
  assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms.

Gibson Assembly
  A molecular cloning method which allows for the joining of
  multiple DNA fragments in a single, isothermal reaction.

  We use "cloning" here is because it involves the replication of one molecule
  to produce a population of cells with identical DNA molecules.
Gibson Cloning

Cell Transformations
DNA mini-preps
Restriction Digests
Gel Electrophoresis
Isolate your own DNA
PCR amplification
DNA sequencing

Plasmid
  a genetic structure in a cell that can replicate
  independently of the chromosomes (via a self-replicating
  unit called a "replicon") typically a small circular DNA
  strand in the cytoplasm of a bacterium or protozoan.
  Plasmids are much used in the laboratory manipulation of genes.
  (these are apparently very important and I should read more about them)
PCR
  Polymerase Chain Reaction
  is a machine (physical machine, I can see it with my eyes)
PCR amplify
  Creates more copies of a thing
  We'll use it to create copies of just the pieces we're interested in
  which we specify with our primer
Neucleotide
  One of the ATGC chemicals in the DNA, and supporting structure
SNP
  pronounced "snip"
  Single Neucleotide Polymorphism
  Metadata telling us a region of DNA that marks a mutation as a location of interest (ie an eye colour)
  They have names like i7600
Primer
  An enzyme that locates the part of the DNA we're interested in
Enzyme
  able to bond with a section of DNA or protein
Sequencing
  Identifying the letters on some strand of DNA
Sanger Sequencing
Phenotype
Gene
  Heritable unit for transmission of biological traits
  A locus (region) of DNA that encodes function
  made up of DNA
  act as instructions to make proteins
  In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million
Chromosome
  long strand of DNA containing many genes
  human chromosomes can have up to
    500 million base pairs
    thousands of genes
Protein
  molecule
Restriction digest
  the process of cutting DNA molecules into smaller pieces with special enzymes called "Restriction Endonucleases" / "Restriction enzymes"
